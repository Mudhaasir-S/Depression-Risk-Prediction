Depression is a growing global health issue, and early identification of individuals at risk is crucial for effective intervention. This project explores depression risk prediction using **unsupervised machine learning**, focusing on **K-Means clustering**.

## 🔍 Project Objective

To identify clusters or patterns among individuals based on:
- Lifestyle and physical health
- Mental health history
- Social interactions and sleep habits

without relying on any predefined labels.

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: Null handling, normalization, and encoding of categorical variables
- **Clustering Algorithm**: K-Means
- **Evaluation**:
  - Elbow Method for optimal `k`
  - PCA for 2D visualization of clusters
- **Interpretation**: Each cluster represents a group with distinct depression risk profiles

## 📊 Output

- Clusters visualized via PCA
- Insights into risk factors and mental health patterns
- Exportable cluster results for downstream health analytics
